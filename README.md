# leadsheets
this android app is in a very early stage right now. the basic idea is to display and create music lead sheets based on *.txt-files,
which are locally saved on your sd-card, so that you can sync them with external tools like FolderSync to services like Google Drive or 
Dropbox, with the following goals: 

- easier creation of the leadsheets from a pc/notebook
- continuous backup of the data
- no walled garden (like pretty much every leadsheet app that is pdf based)
- in contrast to editing pdfs (drawing on them and stuff), changes to text files are stored instantly in the file itself, whereas annotated pdfs need to be 
exported manually - this makes it easy to loose your changes if your device crashes and you didn't manually export the changes.
- it's possible to use the data even if you don't want to use the app anymore, since it's just plain text

the following features are on the agenda:
- different folders for different projets
- one easy to use, sortable setlist per folder
- fullscreen display of all sheets beneath each other for live performance (-> less touching the screen during songs)
